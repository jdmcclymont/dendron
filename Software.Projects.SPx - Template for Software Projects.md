(Using the Scrum/Sprint model is recommended. A Sprint comprises four steps:

1. Development, The work packet is initiated. The development team completes the analysis, design, implementation  testing and documentation.
2. Wrap. The packet is wrapped. In other words, the work packet is closed. The code is verified as operational, and documentation of the work is created.
3. Review. The project team reviews the work, points out and resolves issues, and adds items to the backlog for future resolution.
4. Adjustment. The results of the review process are documented and, if necessary, compiled into work packets.

Following the Sprinting processes, the project enters the closure phase where the project results are tested and deemed accurate, and the software is then made ready for release.)
